# uptime-gadget-tasks

> Grunt tasks to compress gadgets and commit to a Maven repository.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install uptime-gadget-tasks --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('uptime-gadget-tasks');
```

## The "uptime-gadget" tasks

#### "compress" task
_Run this task with the 'grunt uptime-gadget:compress' command_

This will compress everything in the src/ folder into target/[GadgetName].zip

_Run this task with 'grunt uptime-gadget:compress --target=[desired_output_folder]' to output to a specific folder other than target/_

#### "mavenDeploy" task
Make sure to have a config file 'mavenOptions.json' present before running this file.  See Maven Options section for more

_Run this task with the 'grunt uptime-gadget:mavenDeploy' command_

{
	"groupId": "[group_id]",
	"snapshotRepositoryId": "[snapshot repository id used for authentication purposes, as pulled from ~/.m2/settings.xml]",
